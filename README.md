# TELCO CHURN PREDICTION EDA

## Problem Statement:
Churn quantifies the number of customers who have left your brand by cancelling their subscription or stopping paying for your services. This is bad news for any business as it costs five times as much to attract a new customer as it does to keep an existing one. A high customer churn rate will hit your company’s finances hard. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning (ML), you will be able to anticipate potential churners who are about to abandon your services.
